# Stargardt-s-Disease-Analysis
Stargardt disease, also known as Stargardt macular dystrophy (SMD), is a genetic disease of the retina that occurs mainly in childhood or adolescence. This leads to progressive vision loss due to degeneration of the macula, the central part of the retina that is essential for sharp tissues.
Identifyied ABCA4 gene variants for Stargardt disease, emphasizing new mutations and
their impact on retinal physiology.
Understanding advanced imaging (OCT, adaptive optics) and AI algorithms for precise
Stargardt disease diagnosis and progression monitoring.
Implement a robust big data framework for large-scale image datasets, emphasizing
computational efficiency and scalability in disease analysis.
